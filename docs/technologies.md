Qia audio Player is a web application which runs on web browsers. After being loaded, it also works well when there is no Internet connection.

It is developed in vanilla JavaScript (without so-called frameworks) and depends on two open source projects including music-metadata-browser (for retrieving audio metadata) and speex.js (for supporting audio encoded in the speex format).

Technologies in use includes:

* JavaScript
  * Typed Array
* Web API
  * Fetch API
  * Canvas API
  * Web Audio API
  * Web Worker API
  * Web Storage API
